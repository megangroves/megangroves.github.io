            <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
            
            <p>I've redacted companies in stealth, where I'm a silent investor, or who have disappeared.</p>
            
            <p>AI seems to be a categorical investment trend, but I see it as a foundational technology that brings enablement and competitive advantage to companies with a clear definition of a value proposition. Many of the above companies are also "AI companies," but I've aligned them to a truer vertical.</p>
